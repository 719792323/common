输入：
Project table:
+-------------+-------------+
| project_id  | employee_id |
+-------------+-------------+
| 1           | 1           |
| 1           | 2           |
| 1           | 3           |
| 2           | 1           |
| 2           | 4           |
+-------------+-------------+
Employee table:
+-------------+--------+------------------+
| employee_id | name   | experience_years |
+-------------+--------+------------------+
| 1           | Khaled | 3                |
| 2           | Ali    | 2                |
| 3           | John   | 1                |
| 4           | Doe    | 2                |
+-------------+--------+------------------+
输出：

| project_id  |

| 1           |
+-------------+
```

求：project表中分组内元素最多对应的project_id

* 我的解法:该解法用limit导致如果有多个相同数量的分组时会出错

  ````sql
  select project_id from 
  (
      select 
      project_id,count(*) total
      from Project
      group by project_id
      order by total desc
      limit 1
  ) t1 
  ````

* 使用窗口函数

  ```sql
  select project_id from (
      select project_id,rank()over(order by total desc) rnk from 
          (
              select 
              project_id,count(*) total
              from Project
              group by project_id
          ) t1 
      ) t2
  where rnk=1
  ```

* 使用having+all条件，即>=count中最大值

  ```sql
  select project_id 
  from Project 
  group by project_id 
  having count(employee_id) >=
      all(
      select count(project_id)
      from Project 
      group by project_id 
  );
  ```
